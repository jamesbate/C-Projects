# C-Projects 

These are a few of the projects I created in C++ to learn the ropes of programming. These are only small projects which I made to learn specific parts of the languages. When studying Physics at Oxford, I quickly 
turned to Python to create more developped programs related to my course. 

## Contents 

* FermiLabMuonsROOT : This is the code I created as part of a practical lab at Oxford. The code is designed to work with the ROOT data analysis software used at CERN to find muon signals. My project report is included to for detail. 

* Socket : I spent some time experimenting with sockets in C++. I quickly realised that it was more enlightening to use some of the build in tools in Linux such as telnet and netcat to learn the basics fo networking. 

* Battleships_final : A small battleships game, one of my earliest C++ projects which I used to learn about classes and object orientated coding.
